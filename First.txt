This is a small practice in English for you, my sweet. You are my best friend and a teacher. I am very glad I met you. I can not imagine that I could be with someone other. I hope you will never be disappointed in me. I want you to be proud of me. Because your opinion is very important to me. I love you. And I want to give you a happy life.
